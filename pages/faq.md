# FAQ

## Who are you?

My name's Andrew Bell. I like to think about sound, security, and spaceships.

## So you're some sort of computery person?

I work for a travel metasearch company called [Skyscanner](http://www.skyscanner.net), where I create systems that chuck around lots of data very quickly. If you like solving interesting problems by making data hug each other, [we're hiring](http://www.skyscanner.net/jobs).

Outside of work, my most loved passions are acoustics, sound engineering, computer security, classical music, and moths.

## Where are you from?

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland, where I can often be found [running around on hills wearing very few clothes](http://www.beltane.org). Sometimes, I hit a drum while I do this.

## I don't believe you!
