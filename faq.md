### Who the hell are you?

My name's Andrew Bell. I like to think about sound, security, and spaceships.

### So you're some sort of computery person?

I work for a travel metasearch company called [Skyscanner][skyscanner-home], where I create systems that chuck around lots of data very quickly. If you like solving interesting problems by making data hug each other, [we're hiring][skyscanner-jobs].

Outside of work, my most loved passions are acoustics, sound engineering, computer security, classical music, and moths.

### Where are you from?

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland, where I can often be found [running around on hills wearing very few clothes][beltane]. Sometimes, I hit a drum while I do this.

### I don't believe you!

### Don't you get cold?

Only if I stop drumming.

All code on my [GitHub account][github-account] may be used under a [GPLv3 license][gpl-license], unless stated otherwise.

### I really enjoy reading your blog! How can I show my appreciation?

Share my posts! That's all I ask.

### Can I contact you?

I would be delighted if you did! You can contact me by e-mail at [evoludo@gmail.com][e-mail].

### Do you have a resum√©?

Yes, you can find it [here][resume]. I also have a [LinkedIn][linkedin-account] account.

### Do you like cats?

I'M GLAD YOU ASKED! I live with two cats: a jet black contrary menace called Dr Meowface, and a murderous psychopath in a tuxedo called Lord Kittington.
